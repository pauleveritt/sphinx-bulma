sphinx-bulma
============

A modern Sphinx theme, based on Bulma and https://github.com/jeblister/bulma

Running
=======

You can run a development server based on
`livereload <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/livereload>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 ./run_liveload.py

As your `*.rst` files change, or anything in `src`, Sphinx will rebuild and
your browser will reload.
