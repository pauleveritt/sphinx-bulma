# TODO 

- In layout, get header/section/section/footer correct

## Logo

- Make into a "component"
    * Separate directory
    * Separate template
    * Separate .scss

- Do the other "components"
- Reduce the amount of Bulma that is getting imported
- Theme-settings to have an image or text

- Rounded logo that expands outside of header

- Responsive
  * Eliminate words
  * Smaller version of image

## Other

- Use webpack to merge the JS

- Home page hero heading splash area

    * Not so tall
    * Fill in "Hero Heading" on home page and move it up a little bit
    * Make the splash graphic driven by theme option
    * Have the three menus on home page driven by some actual content

- Side menu moves below content on lower resolution

- Footer
  * Have enough theme options to cover everything in footer
  * Copyright

- Menus: Blog, Articles, Tutorials, About, Search

- Listing pages with decent styles

- Previous/Next at top/bottom of article

- Sidenav
  * In-page ToC, categories, tags, parents ("Located In")
  * Less padding

## Later

- Comments

- Normalize the padding and font-size settings by adopting Bulma 
  pre-defined adjustments

## Much Later

- PWA degrades on fonts and splash graphics
